\usage{
susie_rss(
  z,
  R,
  n,
  bhat,
  shat,
  var_y,
  z_ld_weight = 0,
  estimate_residual_variance = FALSE,
  prior_variance = 50,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{p-vector of z-scores.}

\item{R}{p x p correlation matrix.}

\item{n}{The sample size.}

\item{bhat}{Alternative summary data giving the estimated effects
(a vector of length p). This, together with \code{shat}, may be
provided instead of \code{z}.}

\item{shat}{Alternative summary data giving the standard errors of
the estimated effects (a vector of length p). This, together with
\code{bhat}, may be provided instead of \code{z}.}

\item{var_y}{The sample variance of y, defined as \eqn{y'y/(n-1)}.
When the sample variance is not provided, the coefficients
(returned from \code{coef}) are computed on the
\dQuote{standardized} X, y scale.}

\item{z_ld_weight}{This parameter is included for backwards
compatibility with previous versions of the function, but it is no
longer recommended to set this to a non-zero value. When
\code{z_ld_weight > 0}, the matrix \code{R} is adjusted to be
\code{cov2cor((1-w)*R + w*tcrossprod(z))}, where \code{w =
z_ld_weight}.}

\item{estimate_residual_variance}{The default is FALSE, the
residual variance is fixed to 1 or variance of y. If the in-sample
LD matrix is provided, we recommend setting
\code{estimate_residual_variance = TRUE}.}

\item{prior_variance}{The prior variance(s) for the non-zero
noncentrality parameterss \eqn{\tilde{b}_l}. It is either a scalar,
or a vector of length L. When the \code{susie_suff_stat} option
\code{estimate_prior_variance} is set to \code{TRUE} (which is
highly recommended) this simply provides an initial value for the
prior variance. The default value of 50 is simply intended to be a
large initial value. Note this setting is only relevant when
\code{n} is unknown. If \code{n} is known, the relevant option is
\code{scaled_prior_variance} in \code{\link{susie_suff_stat}}.}

\item{check_prior}{When \code{check_prior = TRUE}, it checks if the
estimated prior variance becomes unreasonably large (comparing with
100 * max(abs(z))^2).}

\item{\dots}{Other parameters to be passed to
\code{\link{susie_suff_stat}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{"susie"} object with the following
  elements:

\item{alpha}{An L by p matrix of posterior inclusion probabilites.}

\item{mu}{An L by p matrix of posterior means, conditional on
  inclusion.}

\item{mu2}{An L by p matrix of posterior second moments,
  conditional on inclusion.}

\item{lbf}{log-Bayes Factor for each single effect.}

\item{lbf_variable}{log-Bayes Factor for each variable and single effect.}

\item{V}{Prior variance of the non-zero elements of b.}

\item{elbo}{The value of the variational lower bound, or
  \dQuote{ELBO} (objective function to be maximized), achieved at
  each iteration of the IBSS fitting procedure.}

\item{sets}{Credible sets estimated from model fit; see
  \code{\link{susie_get_cs}} for details.}

\item{pip}{A vector of length p giving the (marginal) posterior
  inclusion probabilities for all p covariates.}

\item{niter}{Number of IBSS iterations that were performed.}

\item{converged}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} indicating whether
  the IBSS converged to a solution within the chosen tolerance
  level.}
}
\description{
\code{susie_rss} performs variable selection under a
  sparse Bayesian multiple linear regression of \eqn{Y} on \eqn{X}
  using the z-scores from standard univariate regression
  of \eqn{Y} on each column of \eqn{X}, an estimate, \eqn{R}, of
  the correlation matrix for the columns of \eqn{X}, and optionally,
  \emph{but strongly recommended}, the sample size n. See
  \dQuote{Details} for other ways to call \code{susie_rss}
}
\details{
In some applications, particularly genetic applications,
it is desired to fit a regression model (\eqn{Y = Xb + E} say,
which we refer to as "the original regression model" or ORM)
without access to the actual values of \eqn{Y} and \eqn{X}, but
given only some summary statistics. \code{susie_rss} assumes
availability of z-scores from standard univariate regression of
\eqn{Y} on each column of \eqn{X}, and an estimate, \eqn{R}, of the
correlation matrix for the columns of \eqn{X} (in genetic
applications \eqn{R} is sometimes called the \dQuote{LD matrix}).

With the inputs \code{z}, \code{R} and sample size \code{n},
\code{susie_rss} computes PVE-adjusted z-scores \code{z_tilde}, and
calls \code{susie_suff_stat} with \code{XtX = (n-1)R}, \code{Xty =
} \eqn{\sqrt{n-1} z_tilde}, \code{yty = n-1}, \code{n = n}. The
output effect estimates are on the scale of \eqn{b} in the ORM with
\emph{standardized} \eqn{X} and \eqn{y}. When the LD matrix
\code{R} and the z-scores \code{z} are computed using the same
matrix \eqn{X}, the results from \code{susie_rss} are same as, or
very similar to, \code{susie} with \emph{standardized} \eqn{X} and
\eqn{y}.

Alternatively, if the user provides \code{n}, \code{bhat} (the
univariate OLS estimates from regressing \eqn{y} on each column of
\eqn{X}), \code{shat} (the standard errors from these OLS
regressions), the in-sample correlation matrix \eqn{R =
cov2cor(crossprod(X))}, and the variance of \eqn{y}, the results
from \code{susie_rss} are same as \code{susie} with \eqn{X} and
\eqn{y}. The effect estimates are on the same scale as the
coefficients \eqn{b} in the ORM with \eqn{X} and \eqn{y}.

In rare cases in which the sample size, \eqn{n}, is unknown,
\code{susie_rss} calls \code{susie_suff_stat} with \code{XtX = R}
and \code{Xty = z}, and with \code{residual_variance = 1}. The
underlying assumption of performing the analysis in this way is
that the sample size is large (\emph{i.e.}, infinity), and/or the
effects are small. More formally, this combines the log-likelihood
for the noncentrality parameters, \eqn{\tilde{b} = \sqrt{n} b},
\deqn{L(\tilde{b}; z, R) = -(\tilde{b}'R\tilde{b} -
2z'\tilde{b})/2,} with the \dQuote{susie prior} on
\eqn{\tilde{b}}; see \code{\link{susie}} and Wang \emph{et al}
(2020) for details. In this case, the effect estimates returned by
\code{susie_rss} are on the noncentrality parameter scale.

The \code{estimate_residual_variance} setting is \code{FALSE} by
default, which is recommended when the LD matrix is estimated from
a reference panel. When the LD matrix \code{R} and the summary
statistics \code{z} (or \code{bhat}, \code{shat}) are computed
using the same matrix \eqn{X}, we recommend setting
\code{estimate_residual_variance = TRUE}.

# In this second toy example, the only difference is that one
